    <h1>the Greatest Painters</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>LEONARDO DA VINCI</h2><br>
    <p>Not only did Leonardo da Vinci experiment with mediums, but he also innovated different ways of creating striking compositions. In fact, his signature triangular composition is still used today and is widely considered one of the most visually pleasing painting layouts. He was also an early advocate of studying anatomical models to perfect his art, something that was illegal at the time.

        </li>
        <li><h2>MICHELANGELO</h2><br>
            <p>While Michelangelo may have viewed himself as a sculptor, his placement on this list shows his true genius. Though relatively few Michelangelo paintings survive, those that do are considered some of the best in the world. His ability to quickly master fresco painting and take it to new heights is evident in both the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and The Last Judgement, which continue to inspire artists today.

            <li><h2>ARTEMISIA GENTILESCHI</h2><br>
                <p>This powerhouse of Baroque painting is also one of the first female artists to see great success. Through the course of the 17th century, Artemisia Gentileschi created dynamic and explosive paintings that feature her trademark chiaroscuro and rich colors. While her art was sometimes overshadowed by her Baroque peer Caravaggio, over time her incredible skill and role in pioneering female artists have come to be appreciated.

                    <li><h2>VINCENT VAN GOGH</h2><br>
                        <p>Though he is seen today as one of the most influential painters in Western art, Vincent van Gogh was not commercially successful during his lifetime. Since the early 20th century, however, his masterful paintings have been prized for their expressive emotion. Filled with dramatic brushstrokes and bold color, the Post-Impressionist painter's artwork is a roadmap to modern art.
